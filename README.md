#  FormsExample

A small demonstration of a method to create forms (Log in/register) without using a UITableView or UICollectionView instance

This makes use of static layouts using a UIStackView nested inside a UIScrollView. The advantage of this approach is that you do not need to worry about dequeuing cells, cells being reused, delegates being changed, etc.
